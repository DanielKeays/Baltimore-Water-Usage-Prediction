# Baltimore Water Usage Prediction

## Objective 
The purpose of this project is to predict future water usage amounts by using machine learning techinques. I use data with an annual frequency and there are 79 observations. The main evaluation metric used is the Root-Mean-Square-Error test.

### Methods Used 
* Machine Learning 
* Predictive Modelling 
* Data Visualization 
* Inferential Statistics 

### Technologies 
* Python
* Jupyter 

## Project Description 
* The dataset used for this project is the Baltimore water usage dataset where the annual water usage for households ranges from the year 1885 up until 1963.
* Machine learning techniques, including the use of the ARIMA Model, were used to make a strong and accurate prediction for the next years water usage for household in the Baltimore area. 
* Data visualization techniques used in this project include: barplots, histograms, kearnal density plots, and partial/full autocorrelation line plots.
